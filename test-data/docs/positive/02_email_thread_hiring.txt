Hi Team,

Following up on our discussion from yesterday's meeting. We need to make a decision on the Senior Engineering Manager role.

CANDIDATE COMPARISON:

Candidate A (John Smith):
- 8 years experience at FAANG companies
- Strong technical background in distributed systems
- Leadership experience: Managed team of 15 engineers
- Cultural fit: High (references were glowing)
- Salary expectation: $180K base + equity
- Start date: Available immediately

Candidate B (Maria Garcia):
- 12 years experience, mix of startups and enterprise
- Strong in both technical and people management
- Leadership experience: Built team from 5 to 50 engineers
- Cultural fit: High (very collaborative style)
- Salary expectation: $195K base + equity
- Start date: 2 weeks notice period

DECISION FACTORS:
1. We need someone who can scale the team quickly (we're planning to grow from 20 to 50 engineers this year)
2. Budget constraints: We have $200K allocated for this role
3. Urgency: We need someone onboarded before Q2 planning cycle (starts March 1)

MY RECOMMENDATION:
I recommend Candidate B (Maria Garcia). While she's slightly more expensive, her experience scaling teams aligns perfectly with our needs. The 2-week notice period is acceptable given our timeline.

What does everyone think? Can we get approval to move forward?

Best,
Michael
