POLICY DECISION: LLM Training Data Usage
Document ID: POL-2024-003
Effective Date: March 1, 2024
Status: APPROVED
Decision Maker: AI Ethics Committee

POLICY STATEMENT
This policy establishes guidelines for the use of customer data in training Large Language Models (LLMs) and other AI systems.

DECISION CONTEXT
Our company is developing an AI-powered customer support system that requires training on customer interaction data. The legal and ethics teams raised concerns about data privacy, consent, and regulatory compliance.

KEY CONSIDERATIONS
1. Customer Privacy: Customers have not explicitly consented to their data being used for AI training
2. Regulatory Compliance: GDPR, CCPA, and other regulations may restrict data usage
3. Competitive Advantage: Training on our proprietary data could improve model performance
4. Ethical Concerns: Using customer data without consent raises ethical questions
5. Business Need: The AI system is critical for scaling customer support operations

DECISION
After extensive review, the AI Ethics Committee has decided to:
- PROHIBIT the use of customer data in LLM training without explicit opt-in consent
- ALLOW the use of anonymized, aggregated data for model fine-tuning
- REQUIRE all AI training data to be reviewed by the legal team
- MANDATE regular audits of AI training datasets

RATIONALE
1. Legal Risk: Using customer data without consent exposes us to regulatory fines and lawsuits
2. Trust: Customers expect their data to be used only for stated purposes
3. Reputation: Violating customer trust could damage brand reputation
4. Compliance: Proactive compliance reduces regulatory risk

EXCEPTIONS
The following exceptions are permitted:
- Publicly available data (with proper attribution)
- Data explicitly licensed for AI training
- Synthetic data generated from approved sources
- Customer data with explicit written consent

IMPLEMENTATION REQUIREMENTS
1. All AI/ML teams must submit training data for review before use
2. Legal team will maintain a registry of approved training datasets
3. Quarterly audits will verify compliance
4. Violations will result in immediate project suspension
