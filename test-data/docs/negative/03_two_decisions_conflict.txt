DECISION MEMO #1: Marketing Budget Allocation
Date: March 1, 2024
Decision: Allocate $1M to digital advertising campaigns
Rationale: Digital channels show highest ROI (3:1)
Approved by: CMO

---

DECISION MEMO #2: Marketing Budget Allocation  
Date: March 5, 2024
Decision: Allocate $1M to traditional media (TV, radio, print)
Rationale: Brand awareness requires broad reach, traditional media more effective
Approved by: CEO

CONFLICT ANALYSIS:
Both decisions allocate the same $1M budget but to completely different channels. Only one can be executed. This represents a clear conflict in decision-making authority and strategic direction.

The first decision (March 1) was made by the CMO focusing on ROI metrics.
The second decision (March 5) was made by the CEO focusing on brand awareness.

This conflict suggests:
1. Lack of coordination between C-level executives
2. Unclear decision-making authority
3. Conflicting strategic priorities
4. Budget allocation process breakdown

RESOLUTION NEEDED:
- Clarify which decision takes precedence
- Establish clear decision-making hierarchy
- Review budget allocation process
- Align on strategic priorities
