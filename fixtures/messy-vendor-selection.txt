VENDOR SELECTION - CRM Platform Decision
Date: February 28, 2024
Team: Procurement, IT, Sales, Finance

BACKGROUND:
We need to select a new CRM platform. Current system is outdated and causing issues.
Budget: $200k/year (according to Finance)
Timeline: Need to decide by March 15, 2024

CANDIDATES:
1. Vendor A: SalesForce Enterprise
2. Vendor B: HubSpot Pro
3. Vendor C: Custom Build (in-house)

VENDOR A - SalesForce Enterprise:
- Cost: $300/user/month × 50 users = $180k/year
- Wait, that's $180k, not $200k. But Finance said budget is $200k.
- Features: Full CRM, marketing automation, analytics
- Implementation: 3-4 months, $50k setup fee
- Support: 24/7, included
- Sales rep says: "Best in class, used by Fortune 500 companies"
- Our IT team says: "Complex, requires dedicated admin, steep learning curve"

VENDOR B - HubSpot Pro:
- Cost: $800/user/month × 20 users = $192k/year
- Wait, that doesn't add up. $800 × 20 = $16k/month = $192k/year. But they quoted $150k/year.
- Let me recalculate: HubSpot website says $800/user/month for Pro, but our quote says $150k/year for 20 users. Something's off.
- Features: CRM, marketing, sales, service hub
- Implementation: 2-3 months, $25k setup fee
- Support: Business hours, included
- Sales rep says: "Easier to use than SalesForce, better for SMBs"
- Our Sales team says: "We tried HubSpot before, it was too limited"

VENDOR C - Custom Build:
- Cost: $150k development + $50k/year maintenance = $200k first year, $50k/year after
- Timeline: 6-9 months development
- Features: Exactly what we need (custom)
- Risk: What if developers leave? What if requirements change?
- IT says: "We can build it, but it's a lot of work"
- Finance says: "Long-term it's cheaper, but upfront cost is high"

CONFLICTING OPINIONS:

Sales Team:
- "We need SalesForce. It's the industry standard."
- "HubSpot didn't work for us last time. Why try again?"
- "Custom build will take too long. We need something now."

IT Team:
- "SalesForce is overkill. We don't need all those features."
- "HubSpot is easier to manage, less training needed."
- "Custom build gives us control, but it's risky."

Finance:
- "Budget is $200k/year. SalesForce is $180k + $50k setup = $230k first year. Over budget."
- "HubSpot quote says $150k/year, but website says $192k. Which is correct?"
- "Custom build is $200k first year, then $50k/year. Cheaper long-term."

Procurement:
- "We need to compare apples to apples. The pricing is inconsistent."
- "SalesForce has better support, but costs more."
- "HubSpot is cheaper, but we had issues before."

MISSING INFORMATION:
- What's the actual HubSpot pricing? Quote says $150k, website says $192k. Need clarification.
- What were the specific issues with HubSpot last time? Sales says "too limited" but no details.
- What's the real SalesForce cost? $180k/year or $230k first year? Setup fee is one-time?
- What are our actual requirements? Everyone has different needs.
- How many users do we really need? Sales says 50, IT says 30, Finance says 20.
- What's the migration cost? Moving data from current system to new one.
- What's the training cost? SalesForce needs more training than HubSpot.
- What's the ROI? No one has calculated this.

NUMERIC CLAIMS (DISPUTED):

User Count:
- Sales: "We need 50 users"
- IT: "30 users is enough, rest can be read-only"
- Finance: "20 users max, based on budget"
- Actual current usage: 35 active users

Cost Estimates:
- SalesForce: Sales rep says $180k/year, Finance calculates $230k first year
- HubSpot: Quote says $150k/year, website says $192k/year
- Custom: IT says $150k dev + $50k/year, Finance says $200k dev + $60k/year

Timeline:
- SalesForce: Sales rep says 3 months, IT says 4-6 months
- HubSpot: Sales rep says 2 months, IT says 3-4 months
- Custom: IT says 6 months, Finance says 9-12 months

User Satisfaction (from previous HubSpot trial):
- Sales: "3/10, too limited"
- IT: "7/10, easy to use"
- Marketing: "8/10, great features"
- No consensus on why we stopped using it

OPTIONS:

Option 1: SalesForce Enterprise
- Pros: Industry standard, full features, good support
- Cons: Expensive ($230k first year), complex, over budget
- Risk: Over budget, may not use all features

Option 2: HubSpot Pro
- Pros: Cheaper ($150k?), easier to use, good for SMBs
- Cons: We tried it before and it didn't work, pricing unclear
- Risk: May have same issues as before, pricing discrepancy

Option 3: Custom Build
- Pros: Exactly what we need, cheaper long-term, full control
- Cons: Long development time (6-9 months), risky, maintenance burden
- Risk: Delays, cost overruns, maintenance issues

Option 4: Hybrid Approach
- Start with HubSpot for immediate needs ($150k/year)
- Build custom solution in parallel (6-9 months)
- Migrate to custom when ready
- Total: $150k + $200k = $350k first year (way over budget)

DECISION CRITERIA (unclear):
- Cost: What's the actual budget? $200k/year or $230k first year?
- Timeline: When do we need it? Sales says "ASAP", IT says "Q2 is fine"
- Features: What do we actually need? No one has documented requirements
- Risk: What's acceptable? Finance wants low risk, Sales wants fast, IT wants flexible

CONFLICTS TO RESOLVE:
1. Budget: $200k/year vs $230k first year (SalesForce)
2. Pricing: HubSpot quote ($150k) vs website ($192k)
3. User count: 20 vs 30 vs 50 users
4. Timeline: ASAP vs Q2 vs 6-9 months
5. Previous HubSpot experience: Why did it fail? Can we avoid same issues?

ACTION ITEMS:
- [ ] Clarify HubSpot pricing (Procurement)
- [ ] Document actual requirements (all teams)
- [ ] Calculate total cost of ownership for each option (Finance)
- [ ] Assess migration effort and cost (IT)
- [ ] Get user count consensus (all teams)
- [ ] Review previous HubSpot issues (Sales + IT)
- [ ] Get SalesForce setup fee clarification (Procurement)

NEXT MEETING: March 5, 2024
Goal: Make final decision by March 15

DECISION STATUS: PENDING - Too many conflicts and missing information
