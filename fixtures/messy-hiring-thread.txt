Subject: Re: Hiring Decision - Engineering Manager Position

Hey team,

I've been reviewing the candidates and I think we should go with Sarah Chen. She has 10 years of experience and her references were glowing. The recruiter said she's the top candidate with a 95% match score.

But wait - John mentioned that we need someone who can start immediately. Sarah said she needs 2 months notice at her current job.

Also, the budget is tight. HR said we can only offer $150k max, but Sarah's asking for $180k. However, I heard from someone that the market rate is actually $200k for this role.

Mike from Finance said we have flexibility if it's the right candidate, but I'm not sure that's accurate given the Q4 budget review. The budget document shows $150k, but Mike claims we can go higher.

What do you all think? Should we:
1. Wait for Sarah (2 months) - best candidate but delayed start
2. Go with David Kim who can start next week - less experience (5 years vs 10)
3. Reopen the search and look for more candidates
4. Consider the internal candidate (Lisa) - she's been asking about the role

I'm leaning toward option 2, but I want to make sure we're not making a mistake. We're missing some key info:
- What's the actual budget approval process?
- How urgent is the need? (John says urgent, but I haven't seen the project timeline)
- What are the exact requirements? The job description is vague.

Thoughts?

Alex - I think we need to move fast. The team is overloaded and we can't wait 2 months. We have 3 projects starting in Q1 and need someone NOW.

The other candidate (David Kim) seems solid. Less experience but he's available now and within budget. His references said he's a "fast learner" which is good.

However, I'm concerned about his lack of management experience. He's only managed 2 people before, and we need someone who can handle a team of 8.

Let's make a decision by Friday. No exceptions.

Subject: Re: Position Offer

Hi Alex,

Thank you for the offer! I'm very interested. However, I would need to give my current employer 2 months notice as per my contract.

I'm also hoping we can discuss the compensation package. I was looking for something in the $180k range based on my experience and the market rate. I've seen similar roles paying $200k, but I'm flexible.

One thing - I noticed the job description mentions "5+ years experience" but I have 10 years. Should we discuss a more senior title or additional responsibilities?

Let me know if we can work something out.

Best,
Sarah

Subject: Budget for Engineering Manager

Alex,

Just to clarify - we have some flexibility in the budget for Q4. The $150k is a guideline, not a hard cap. If you find the right candidate, we can go up to $180k with VP approval.

Actually, wait - I need to check the latest budget numbers. The Q4 review might have changed things. Let me get back to you.

Subject: Internal Candidate Interest

Hi Alex,

I heard about the Engineering Manager opening and I'm very interested. I've been with the company for 3 years and know the team well.

I know I don't have the exact experience listed (I have 4 years in engineering, not 5+), but I've been acting as a de facto team lead for the past year. The team respects me and I understand our processes.

I'd be willing to take a lower salary - maybe $140k? I'm already here, so no notice period needed.

Just wanted to throw my hat in the ring.

Subject: Candidate Comparison

Alex,

Quick update on the candidates:

Sarah Chen: 95% match, 10 years exp, $180k ask, 2 months notice
David Kim: 78% match, 5 years exp, $150k ask, immediate start
Lisa (internal): 65% match, 4 years exp, $140k ask, immediate start

However, I should note that our matching algorithm might be off. Sarah's experience is more in product management than pure engineering management, which could affect the match score.

Also, I don't have complete reference checks for David yet. Should be done by Thursday.

Let me know if you need anything else.
